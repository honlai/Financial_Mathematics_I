        "## Allocation Methods\n",
        "- Allocation methods can be influenced by discretionary decisions, such as shrinkage methods or weight constraints.\n",
        "- The performance of an allocation method can vary depending on the choice of constraints.\n",
        "- It's often unclear if one allocation method is superior to another, due to the portfolio method itself or the constraints applied.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Risk Budgeting Approach\n",
        "- The risk budgeting approach, also known as the 'risk parity' approach, requires fewer discretionary inputs.\n",
        "- Risk parity is one of three budgeting methods in asset allocation, alongside weight budgeting and performance budgeting.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Weight Budgeting (WB)\n",
        "- In WB, weights are directly defined. For example, with a 30/70 policy rule for two assets, the weight of asset one is 30% and the weight of asset two is 70%.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Risk Budgeting (RB)\n",
        "- In RB, the risk budgets of the assets are chosen. With the 30/70 policy rule and a desired risk measure of 20%, the risk budget of asset one is 6% and the risk budget of asset two is 14%.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Performance Budgeting (PB)\n",
        "- PB involves calibrating the weights of the portfolio to achieve certain performance contributions. For example, for a targeted portfolio return of 10%, the performance contribution for the assets would be 3% and 7% respectively.\n",

        "- Measuring the risk of a portfolio is very different from managing it. A risk measure is a single number that doesn't provide much insight into the diversification of the portfolio.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "The definition of coherent risk measures has sparked significant interest in the quantitative management of risk. Föllmer and Schied (2002) suggested replacing the homogeneity and subadditivity conditions with a weaker condition known as the convexity property.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Convexity Property\n",
        "The convexity property is defined as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$R (\\lambda x_1 + (1 - \\lambda) x_2) \\leq \\lambda R (x_1) + (1 - \\lambda) R (x_2)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "This condition implies that diversification should not increase the risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Risk Measures\n",
        "By definition, the loss of the portfolio is $L(x) = -R (x)$ where $R (x)$ is the return of the portfolio. We then consider different risk measures:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Volatility of the Loss\n",
        "The volatility of the loss is the portfolio’s volatility, defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$R (x) = \\sigma (L(x)) = \\sigma (x)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "### Standard Deviation-Based Risk Measure\n",
        "To obtain this measure, we scale the volatility by factor $c > 0$ and subtract the expected return of the portfolio:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$R (x) = SD_c (x) = \\mathbb{E} [L(x)] + c \\cdot \\sigma (L(x)) = -\\mu (x) + c \\cdot \\sigma (x)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "### Value-at-Risk\n",
        "The value-at-risk is the $\\alpha$-quantile of the loss distribution $F$ and we note it $F^{-1}(\\alpha)$:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$R (x) = VaR_\\alpha (x) = inf \\{l : Pr \\{L(x) \\leq l\\} \\geq \\alpha\\}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "### Expected Shortfall\n",
        "The expected shortfall is the average of the VaRs at level $\\alpha$ and higher (Acerbi and Tasche, 2002). It is also equal to the expected loss given that the loss is beyond the value-at-risk:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$R (x) = ES_\\alpha (x) = \\frac{1}{1 - \\alpha} \\int_{\\alpha}^{1} VaR_u (x) du = \\mathbb{E} [L(x) | L(x) \\geq VaR_\\alpha (x)]$$\n",

        "## Coherency and Convexity Conditions\n",
        "The standard deviation-based risk measure and the expected shortfall satisfy the previous coherency and convexity conditions. However, for the value-at-risk, the subadditivity property does not generally hold. This is problematic because the portfolio’s risk may not be meaningful in this case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interestingly, the volatility is not a coherent risk measure because it does not verify the translation invariance axiom. However, such axioms were designed based on an economic (and regulatory) capital allocation perspective for the banking system. The translation invariance axiom is not well adapted for portfolio management. This is why we consider that volatility is a coherent and convex risk measure.\n"
